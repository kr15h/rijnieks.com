Krisjanis Rijnieks

Hello! I am a human being that does a lot of interesting things. Unfortunately I have just one life, one head and two hands and that is not enough to be able to do everything that I would like to. However right now I'm focusing on my MA studies in the New Media program of the Helsinki Media Lab, but in the meantime I do different freelance projects that include:
 - graphic design
 - web design
 - interface design
 - creative coding
 - physical computing
 - and more...

Feel free to contact me if you have something to offer, questions or you want to discuss one of the mentioned topics.
