Welcome to my website! Here you can find information about my latest projects and artistic activities. I have been working with digital interactive media since Macromedia Flash 4 was released in 1999. Currently, I work as a lab manager and Fab Academy instructor at the Aalto Fablab in Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. In the future, I plan to focus on research related (but not limited) to fab labs, digital fabrication and open source. Feel free to connect if you see that we can collaborate in one way or another.
