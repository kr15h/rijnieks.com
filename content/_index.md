Hello! I am Kris. On this website you can find information about my latest projects and artistic activities. I have been working with digital interactive media since Macromedia Flash 4 was released in 1999. Currently I focus on creative solutions that can not be solved by using off-the-shelt software and hardware. I'm currently based in Berlin, Germany. If you want to do a project with me, feel free to communicate by using one of the social network options above.
