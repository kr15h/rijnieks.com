Roja Art Lab is an annual gathering of international artists in Roja, Latvia. For two weeks they are exploring the context and creating artistic reflections. In this article I will try to summarize my experience at the Roja Art Lab 2018 as I am on the list of 10 participants this time.

The Roja Art Lab residency seemed as a nice turn after the 6 month long Fab Academy course in Barcelona. I arrvied in Riga two days before, on July 20. The next day I went to Estonia to explore the results of two international art residencies there. [MAAJAAM](https://www.maajaam.ee/) is a new media oriented residency space that includes a barn-like makerlab. [MoKS](https://moks.ee/) is a residency where artists are encouraged to work with the context of the landscape and features of the local environment.

I arrived in Roja on Sunday, July 22. First thing was to visit the Roja Art Lab venue and meet with the host MƒÅris Grosbahs. After receiving instructions and checking in the hotel, I went to the seaside which is exceptionaly beautiful and calming.

I met a part of other artists that came here for the residency. After a brief small talk it was clear that there may be many options for possible collaboration. After a longer conversation during the opening barbecue, I realized that the plan for most of the participants is to do research during the first week and practical work for the rest of the time.
